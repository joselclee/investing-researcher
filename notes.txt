In both portfolio-optimization.py and monte-carlo-var.py, there is a "ticker" array. Improve it by implementing a method allows a user to
select a ticker from a list of available tickers. The list will be generated using yfinance to check active tickers. There should also be
automated suggestions when typing out certain tickers, ie. "AA" could suggest "AAPL", "MS" to "MSFT", etc.

These variables should also be user changeable:
-start_date
-weights
-
